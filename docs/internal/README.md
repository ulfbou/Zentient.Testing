Zentient.Testing — Internal Documentation

This directory contains the internal wiki pages and documentation intended for maintainers, contributors and early adopters of the alfa release of Zentient.Testing.

Files
- api-reference-alfa.md — full API reference for the alfa release (surface area & examples)
- roadmap.md — short- and medium-term roadmap and release plan
- release-notes-alfa.md — alfa release notes and migration guidance
- contributing.md — contributor guidance, development workflow and commit conventions

How to use
- These pages are written for Markdown-driven hosting (GitHub Pages / Docs). Keep them up to date when you change public APIs.
- API reference is intentionally compact for the alfa; expand signatures and examples as APIs stabilize.

Contact
- For questions about the design or release process open an issue or ping the maintainers in the repository.
