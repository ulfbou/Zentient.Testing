How to use
- These pages are written for Markdown-driven hosting (GitHub Pages / Docs). Keep them up to date when you change public APIs.
- API reference is intentionally compact for the alfa; expand signatures and examples as APIs stabilize.

Contact
- For questions about the design or release process open an issue or ping the maintainers in the repository.

Notes
- These files are internal and should not be published publicly without review. They remain local to maintainers and are intentionally kept out of public releases.
